# 100 Days Of Code Diary 2020

## Day 1

_30th June_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt a new mark-up language called Markdown (the very language I'm now writing in!)
- I sorted out my GitHub repos and pushed up any new changes to my projects.
- I used markdown to create README docs for some of my GitHub repos.

### Thoughts:

I'm feeling really excited to have started 100 Days Of Code and already feel more motivated to code every day. I think having a goal of just one hour a day seems very managable for me, rather than feeling like unless I spend at least 3 hours a day learning it's not worth it.

## Day 2

_1st July_

### Today's progress:

- I started learning SQL and I now know a bit more about databases, select queries, the insert into, update and delete statements, joins, views and indexes. I really enjoyed watching these quirky Socratica videos to get a good overview of the basics!
- Attended a CodeFirstGirls online event at lunchtime to find out more about life as an engineer.

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed learning something brand new today (SQL) and exploring a different area of programming. I was feeling like I needed something fresh and a little break from HTML, CSS and JavaScript and this hit the spot! It's amazing how quickly I am picking up new languages now that I've got a good grasp of HTML, CSS and JS. They all have similarities which really helps.

## Day 3

_2nd July_

### Today's progress:

- I practised some SQL using SQL Bolt which was a really good way to put some theory into practice. I got up to Lesson 10.
- I completed a CodeWars ("Largest Pair Sum In An Array") using the array method sort(). I then refactored it to make it cleaner and more consise.

### Thoughts:

I enjoyed putting my SQL learning into pratice and found that I could recall a lot of what I watched in the videos yesterday which really helped me to complete the exercises. I'm really excited that I was able to complete a 7kyu Kata and then refactor it myself with no help at all! It really boosted my confidence and I finished today's learning on a high!

## Day 4

_3rd July_

### Today's progress:

- I spent some time working on another CodeWars 7kyu Kata ("Sentences Should Start With Capital Letters"), using some string methods (split() and slice()) and array methods (forEach()) to complete it. I found this one harder than yesterday's challenge and needed a little help to complete it. I hadn't used split(". ") like this before so it was a really good learning point.

### Thoughts:

I used to always feel like I'd failed if I couldn't complete a CodeWars kata all by myself and had to ask for help. Rather than seeing it as an opportunity to learn I'd just feel frustrated and disappointed (something to do with me wanting to acheive perfection the whole time!). I've really been working hard to create new pathways in my brain that allow me to not be perfect and to be okay with not knowing things straight away. I'm pleased to say that I'm getting much better at it! I see this kata as a success as I was 80% there and then just needed a little help to get over the final hurdle (in which I learnt something new so that was a valuable process). I think the universe rewarded me as I then got a new rank of 6kyu!

## Day 5

_4th July_

### Today's progress:

- Listened to a SyntaxFM podcast on servers and what makes them fast. I learnt about :

  [RAM](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-ram/) (Random Access Memory) which is basically short term memory in your deivce. It is an extremely fast component that temporarily stores all the information your PC needs right now and in the near future.

  [CPU's](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-a-cpu/) (Central Processing Units) which are responsible for processing and executing instructions.

  [GPU's](https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/30399/what-is-a-gpu) (Graphics Processing Unit) which are processors that are specially-designed to handle intensive graphics rendering tasks.

  [SSD's](https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-ssd) (Solid-State Drives) which are a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSDs replace traditional mechanical hard disks by using flash-based memory which is significantly faster.

- I also watched Lecture 2 (Arrays) of Havard's CS50 course. I'm learning more C as we go along and although it feels a bit different I am noticing the similarities it has with JavaScript.

### Thoughts:

I'm about to write my own server so it was interesting to listen to this podcast and learn about some of their components. When I first started listening to SyntaxFM podcasts I didn't really understand or know about anything they discussed (I just tried to absorb everything). It's nice now to feel a little less out of my depth and to understand much more of what they talk about!

The teaching on the CS50 course is really good and I'm enjoying these videos a lot. It's also interesting to learn a slightly lower level programming language (C) and to understand how things fit together in the wider spectrum of Computer Science.

## Day 6

_5th July_

### Today's progress:

- I did a recap on node.js and learnt how to create and run a programme in node using npm (node package manager).
- I created and edited a package JSON.
- I made my own server using http (a core node module) and then using Express.

### Thoughts:

I understand how it works and want to practice creating more node.js programs and servers to establish some muscle memory with it all. Still not totally sure how it fits into the bigger picture of things though so looking forward to a project where I can work on both the front end and back end which will help me to join the dots.

## Day 7

_6th July_

### Today's progress:

- Continued with Wes Bos' CSS Grid Course and learnt how to make a responsive website with grid without using any media queries! You use the minMax property instead - pretty cool!

### Thoughts:

Found it hard to focus today as I had lots of other non-code related things on my mind which kept distracting me. So I did a shorter session but really pleased I still did something.

## Day 8

_8th July_

### Today's progress:

- I did Wes Bos' Mastering Markdown course and learnt a few new tricks! It was really helpful seeing as I'm going to be using markdown a lot more over the coming weeks as I do this diary.
- I finished writing README files for all my GitHub repo's which was a really useful and productive activity. As I was reflecting on my main learning points for each project, it allowed me recap on lots of useful topics (fetch, asynchronous callback functions, promises, JSON). A really good refresher!
- I created this 100 Days Of Code diary and filled in the last weeks worth of notes. I'm really pleased I'm doing this diary as part of the challenge as it is helping me to reflect upon and consolidate my learning. I think it's also going to be super encouraging to be able to look back on all I've learnt and see how much I've progressed.

### Thoughts:

I'm feeling really good about code at the moment and I've got quite a few things I want to learn about/ achieve this week. I'm in a good flow currently and having the target of one hour a day really helps to motivate me. I am also enjoying the twitter community of 100DaysOfCode and it's encouraging to see other code newbies learning code / having fun / struggling / overcoming problems too. I feel part of something bigger which is a good driving force.

## Day 9

_9th July_

### Today's progress:

- I made a program called Randomizer that console logged a random number between 1 and 6. I created a package JSON and then ran the program in node.
- I made another http server by myself to see if I could remember how (and I could!)
- I finished working through the SQL Bolt Interactive Tutorial and learnt how to implement aggregate expressions (functions), recapped the order of execution of a select query, and then practiced inserting, updating and deleting rows in a table, creating, altering and dropping tables.

### Thoughts:

It was good to dive back in to SQL after a few days away from it. I had to look a few things up again to start with but I soon got back in to it. I found creating the program in node quite easy. I've done a lot of learning theory for the last week so I might start another little project again soon.

## Day 10

_10th July_

### Today's progress:

- I started a new project with Scratch and made an interactive animation about a dancing dinosaur called Dino! It was my first time properly using Scratch and I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to exploring more of its potential.

### Thoughts:

It felt good to work on something creative again after getting stuck into a lot of theory over the last couple of weeks. I really enjoyed the design aspect of it as well as getting it to function in the way I wanted.

### Day 11

_13th July_

### Today's progress:

- I read a really good article entitled [23 Alternative Career Paths That Software Developers Can Grow Into](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/alternative-career-paths/) and spent some time reflecting and researching into which areas of work I might be interested in / suited to. It was really helpful to think about the bigger picture and my end goal for learning to code / getting into tech.

### Thoughts:

As well as being exciting, it can be overwhelming thinking ahead as I am venturing into a industry which is completely new to me. I don't even know all the possible jobs I could get let alone which one I want! But reading this article and looking into a few more roles specifially has helped, and I do know that I want to work as part of team, I really love organising things, communicating with people and feeling on top of / managing situations. At the moment, the roles that I am most drawn to are project manager, product manager, scrum master and teacher / trainer (I have prior experience in teaching), as well as web develper. It's good to bear this in mind as I move forward as I can aim to upskill in the releavent areas and try to connect with people currently in those roles to find out more about them.

### Day 12

_14th July_

### Today's progress:

- I spent all morning researching and learning about Agile Methodolody and the Scrum framework. I found the [Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) particuarly helpful along with their YouTube videos and I now feel like I have a much clearer understanding of agile priciples and agile project management frameworks.

- I also read an article on [Mission, Strategy, Tactics and Vision](https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics). I learnt more about what each of them are and why they are important.

### Thoughts:

Having looked into lots of possible job roles yesterday, I realised that the one skill that ties a lot of them together is the ability to be able to work effectively in a team. This inspired me to look into agile methodology and the scrum framework as I know these are widely used approaches in the tech sector. (I'd also like to look into other frameworks such as Kanban and XP.) I felt inspired after my research / learning and it increased my desire to work in an environment like this and be part of such a well functioning team. Whatever line of work I go into, I know these skills and knowledge will be very useful. I can't wait to join a bootcamp and start learning / working as a team rather than as a solo learner!

### Day 13

_16th July_

### Today's progress:

- I completed the first stage of the School of Code bootcamp applicaton process. I made three avatars using the School of Code's introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript on their learning platform. I also had to write a little bit about why I wanted to do the bootcamp.
- I listened to a Syntax Podcast episode and learnt a bit more about frameworks, fonts and CMS's.

### Thoughts:

I'm really excited to be starting the application stages for SoC and although I found it an easy task and didn't struggle to complete it, I was still a bit nervous about it. I think it's because I've had a lot of time over the last few months to think about how much I want to do the course and it's become quite a big deal to me now. I'm trying to keep things in perspective, stay calm and just do my thing!

### Day 14

_17th July_

### Today's progress:

- I completed the FreeCodeCamp learning section on Applied Accessibility. I learnt that "accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.The main points I took away were that it's important to:

  1. Have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup

  2. Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content

  3. Create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly

I learnt about some HTML tags that are particulay useful and important for this (eg. main, header, footer, section, article, fieldset, legend, date) and that it's important to label images / inputs /graphs, etc. appropriately using alt / for / figcaption. We should also style our pages with CSS in a colour friendly way and use the correct contrast.

### Thoughts:

I was listening to a podcast yesterday in which they mentioned accessibility and it reminded me that it was something I wanted to look into again. I did cover it when I first got into coding but I wanted to refresh myself. It was much easier to take it all in now I've learnt more and have a framework in my mind to attch new knowledge too. It nice to be reminded of how far I've come since March!

### Day 15

_18th July_

### Today's progress:

- I worked on a couple of Codewars challenges and learnt how to chain array methods together!

### Thoughts:

I was really pleased as I managed to complete the 7kyu kata by myself (which I still get really excited about!). I'm finding myself being able to think through the logic of the solution so much faster and I'm able to break down the solution into manageable chunks. This really encourged me as it used to take me ages to even be able to formulate a pseudo plan. It's now happening much more quickly and naturally. Ben helped me with the 6kyu kata and I learnt how to chain together array methods which we'd talked about before but I'd never actually done. This was a really good learning session.

### Day 16

_21st July_

### Today's progress:

- I submitted my School of Code Bootcamp Video Application. This involved answering four different questions (with around a minute for each question) and then ediitng them together into a little film.

- I read an article on [How To Go From A Junior Developer To A Mid-Level Developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-go-from-junior-developer-to-mid-level-developer/). I know I'm a way off yet but it's good to look ahead and make sure I'm going in the right direction!

### Thoughts:

I've had a couple of days off from actual coding as I've been working on my School of Code Bootcamp Video Application which I submitted last night. This involved me spending quite a lot of time planning my answers to four questions and then filming them / editing them together into a little video. I have never done a video interview before and I found it difficult. I think I tend to over-think these things and would have much preferred a live interview! After I'd filmed the different questions I found a video editor on my laptop (which I'd never used before) and I really enjoyed editing the different sections of film together. It was a great new experience and I'd like to do more of it!

### Day 17

_22nd July_

### Today's progress:

- I started work on a little CodePen project using CSS to draw a beach scene. I've not used CoedPen before so it was fun to try it out!

### Thoughts:

It was great to be using CSS again as I've haven't used any for a few weeks. I really enjoy the visual design aspect of coding and get into a nice work flow with it. As I'm in Devon near the beach at the moment I thought I'd create something relevant! Looking forward to finishing this off and getting more stuck into CSS.

### Links to work / resources:

### Day 18

_24th July_

### Today's progress:

- I finished my first Scratch project - an interactive animation called Deeno The Dancing Dinosaur. This is the third part of my School of Code Application and I'm very pleased to have submitted it today!

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed working on this animation project and absolutely loved the creative aspect of it. I also really enjoyed using Scratch - the coding building blocks (with their different shapes and colours) remind me of Lego and serve as a really helpful visual aid to building code. It was a good recap on logical / programmatic thinking.

### Day 19

_29th July_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about the history of open source by listening to a couple of great Command Line Heroes podcasts called OS Wars: Part 1 & 2. It was really interesting to learn more about the history of computing, the development of operating systems and the battles between the big players - Microsoft, Apple and Linux.

### Thoughts:

After completing my School of Code application last week I had a few days off from coding / learing to refresh myself as I realised I'd been feeling quite anxious about the bootcamp application and it felt right to have a little break. Listening to these podcasts was a great was to ease myself back in and I'm feeling inspired to get down to some good coding over the coming weeks!

### Day 20

_31st July_

### Today's progress:

I followed a CodePen tutorial and made a CSS sheep! It was a really helpful exercise and I learnt about quite a few new things such as:

- How to use clip-path to make shapes (and I used [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) to help)

- Using CSS variables

- Using ::before and ::after selectors

I also got to recap on a few things which I'd not done for a while:

- The position property - specifically using absolute and relative

- Positioning elements with %'s

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed making this little sheep! As well as learing a few new things it opened my eyes to how many lines of code is needed just to make one small image with CSS!

![CSS sheep](./Assets/Images/CSS-sheep.PNG)

### Day 21

_2nd August_

### Today's progress:

I used what I learnt making my CSS sheep to add to my Beach Scene (in Codepen):

- I added quite a few other elements including a kite, spade, shark-fin, starfish and shell and I used clip-path to make the shapes of these elements
- I took the process I used to make the sheep fluff and used it to make the cloud (they are very similar!)
- I used the ::before and ::after selectors quite a few times to cut down on div's
- I got much better at positioning using % and px
- I added some animation to the elements using @keyframes and the transform / trnaslate properties

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed making this animated picture and it was great to implement lots of the things I'd learnt about making the CSS sheep into my own project. It's been a really useful few days getting into CSS again and going into detail with positioning and creating shapes.

### Day 22

_3rd August_

### Today's progress:

- I started Wes Bos' JavaScript30 Course and made a drum-kit by following his first tutorial! I learnt about key events, playing audio and listening for the transition end event. I also used an attribute selector which I'd not done before. Then I custom styled it with a video background of a concert so I feel like a rock star when I'm playing it!

- I talked through the code with Ben when I'd finished and explained to him what everything did. I find this helps to solidify my learning and makes sure that I really know what's going on in detail on each line of code, rather than just getting the gist of things.

- I also looked into _this_ as I had to use it again today and wanted a refresher. I found the below very helpful:

## What is this?

The JavaScript _this_ keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

It has different values depending on where it is used:

    In a method, this refers to the owner object.

    Alone, this refers to the global object.

    In a function, this refers to the global object.

    In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

    In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.

    Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.

Handy tip: if you're not sure what 'this' is, just console log it!

### Thoughts:

I've made similar audio apps before so the ideas I used today weren't completely foreign to me but I definitely learnt some new things about events which was really helpful. In terms of technical understanding of the code and committing processes to memory I just find repetition so helpful so the more I can talk through the code / refactor / make more, the better!
